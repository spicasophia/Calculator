# Mini Project 3 - HTML, CSS & JS Calculator

## How I went about the project
1. I went to vscode.dev on my mobile phone to access the mobile web version of Visual Studio Code for the task
2. I connected to a repo I created on my GitHub account
3. I created the index.html, css and js code following the **task breakdown instructions and requirements**, ensuring each requirement is duly followed and every tag is properly opened and closed likewise.
4. After which I saved the file and added this ReadMe to the GitHub repsitory.
